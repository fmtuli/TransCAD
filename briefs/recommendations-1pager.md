Resort Lake 2030 Mobility Strategy — One-Pager Recommendation

Context \& Objective



Resort Lake’s growth and rising tourist inflow intensify PM-peak congestion, especially on Shoreline Hwy. A TransCAD four-step model (2010 base → 2030 horizon) was developed to identify a cost-effective strategy that reduces delay and improves reliability while supporting access and safety. 



Diagnosis (Model Findings)



No-Build 2030 conditions concentrate delay on Shoreline and feeders. Network KPIs (VMT/VHT) and link v/c analyses indicate that capacity-only fixes reduce some pinch points but don’t optimize system-wide performance. 



Options Assessed



Alt 1 – Targeted lane/link adds (Shoreline collector): Lowest cost; weakest travel-time and VHT performance. 



Alt 2 – Upgrade Shoreline to major arterial: Capacity and speed increase (600 → 1,800 veh/hr) improves v/c broadly but leaves residual hot spots. 



Alt 3 – New bus transit + targeted roadway upgrades: Citywide PM-peak bus serving all internal TAZs (15% trip diversion) plus an added lane on Shoreline (remain collector). Best overall flow/v/c patterns across zones. 



Recommendation



Adopt Alternative 3: Transit + Targeted Upgrades. It achieves the lowest VMT (≈ 23,463 mi), lowest VHT (1,277.86), and shortest 4-mi Shoreline travel times (7.76 min AB / 7.08 min BA), outperforming Alts 1–2 despite a higher program cost. This balances congestion relief with person-throughput and environmental co-benefits. 





KPI Snapshot (PM Peak, 2030)

Metric	Alt 1	Alt 2	Alt 3

VMT (mi)	27,409.88	28,230.31	23,463.15

VHT (hr)	1,689.65	1,513.58	1,277.86

Shoreline 4-mi TT (AB, min)	12.91	11.99	7.76

Shoreline 4-mi TT (BA, min)	11.99	7.76	7.08



Order-of-Magnitude Program Costs: Alt 1 ≈ $1.8M, Alt 2 ≈ $3.6M, Alt 3 ≈ $5.7M. 



Implementation Roadmap



Launch Transit Service (Phase-in, PM focus): Begin with 15% O–D diversion planning; coordinate stops near Zone 1 employment and developing Zones 5–6; align schedules to PM peak. 



Targeted Roadway Upgrades: Add Shoreline lane as modeled; minor spot fixes at remaining v/c>1 links. 



First/Last-Mile \& Safety: Sidewalks, crossings, wayfinding near transit to convert latent demand. 



Comms \& Fares: Introductory fare policy and outreach to seed ridership (equity emphasis). 



Risks \& Mitigations



Ridership Ramp-Up: Pair launch with walk/safety upgrades and targeted communications. 



Residual Hot Spots: Post-launch retiming and micro-capacity tweaks on remaining high v/c links.
